Issues that needs fixing in no particular order:

1. Switch contrast color from yellow 400 to f59802
2. Grillz Page have a "margin" on the right side, that makes the component scrollable left/right. This is not supposed to happen. Instead it just needs to fill the screen
3. Create a FAQ pages -> when user clicks on FAQ in the footer, they are led to this page
4. There is a weird visual overlap of EVENTS and BEHIND THE SCENES in the archive page that needs fixing
5. Adding another section of the archive page called INSPIRATION
6. When scrolling on the frontpage, there was a feature that changed the colour of a navbar item based on the position of the user. When looking at rings, the RINGS navbar element changed to the contrast colour, etc.
7. Switch the HERO landing component to a white screen with "GRY" centered in the middle instead of the image
8. Replacing placeholder images with real images
9. Maybe moving the configuration/dependency files into a separate folder for a cleaner codebase
