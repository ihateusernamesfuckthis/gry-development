Done:
1. Switch contrast color from yellow 400 to f59802
2. Grillz Page have a "margin" on the right side, that makes the component scrollable left/right. This is not supposed to happen. Instead it just needs to fill the screen
8. Replacing placeholder images with real images
7. Switch the HERO landing component to a white screen with "GRY" centered in the middle instead of the image
10. Mobile refactoring of grillz page and front page
6. When scrolling on the frontpage, there was a feature that changed the colour of a navbar item based on the position of the user. When looking at rings, the RINGS navbar element changed to the contrast colour, etc.
4. There is a weird visual overlap of EVENTS and BEHIND THE SCENES in the archive page that needs fixing
11. Refactor phone version of navbar
12. add a GRY header at the top right of the phone version of pages
13. fix størrelse på elementer inde på de enkelte produkter
14. fix misaligned buttons
3. Create a FAQ pages -> when user clicks on FAQ in the footer, they are led to this page

Issues that needs fixing in no particular order:

5. Adding another section of the archive page called INSPIRATION
9. Maybe moving the configuration/dependency files into a separate folder for a cleaner codebase
